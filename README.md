This is the 3-stage project assigned to me by Udacity-Google team as part of my training as a mobile web specialist. The project is based on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

* This is a PWA: no external framework is used to produce it; it was plain CSS, JavaScript and HTML5.
* Both Gulp and Grunt were used to minimize the image sizes, css files and JavaScript.
* The app extensively uses off-line capability through a combination of Fetch API, Rest API, Cache API and indexedDB.
* Using the app, a user can access a restaurant, look at reviews, if any, and leave his or her own reviews, to be updated on UI; if the     user is Offline, it posts the data to the database as soon as the connection is established.
* The app is fully responsive and Lighthouse from Devtools shows the following scores:
* Progressive Web >90; Accessibility > 90; SEO > 90
* In order to test the app, you need a separate server. It's, along with instructions, here: https://github.com/hemantha1992/mws-restaurant-stage-3
