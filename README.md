# mws-stage-3
This is the 3-stage project assigned to me by Udacity-Google team as part of my training as a mobile web specialist. The project is based on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
This is a PWA: no external framework is used to produce it; it was plain CSS, JavaScript and HTML5.
Both Gulp and Grunt were used to minimize the image sizes, css files and JavaScript.
